# Gigatron-website-clone
This website clone was done as a final project on Web Design course. It is done in HTML and CSS. The goal was to test and recall everything that we learned during the course.

The website is responsive, done through media queries. I mainly used "float" CSS proprety to position the elements.

There is also a login form linked on the button, as well as a product page for the first product in a row.
